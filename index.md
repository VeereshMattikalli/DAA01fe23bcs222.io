## Div: E
## Team no.: E-3
## Course: 
- Design And Anlysis Algorithm

## Course Code: 
- 24ECSP206

## Course Instructor: 
- Dr. Prakash Hegde

## What is the course about? 
- The course is designed to understand how real world entities help us in solving computational problems and also develop analytical skills.It also helps to understand the method of solving the problem which leads to finding better solutions in terms of efficiency.

## Data Structures And Algorithms Studied:
- Different types of trees n-ary trees, AVL trees, Red-Black trees, Trie, Skip list, segment trees, lookup table, Fenwick trees, Heap, Graphs -Many Algorithms that include different Sorting algorithms like Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap sort. String search algorithms like Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp. Different algorithms to solve Graph problems like Krushkal, Dijkstra, Floyd, Prim's etc.

## How do you connect the course with real time applications? 
- We connect this to the real world for example we use sorting algorithms in big organisations or companies to sort there database entries. Knuth-Moris-Pratt can be used to match DNA in forensic labs,etc
